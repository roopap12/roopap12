## 🚀 About Me

I’m a certified RPA Developer, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Backend Developer with a background in business and finance — now focused on creating secure, efficient, and scalable digital solutions.

After a significant turning point in my professional journey, I embraced a full career transformation and committed myself to learning and building in tech. Since then, I’ve delivered hands-on projects that merge automation, backend logic, and cybersecurity awareness to solve real-world problems.

My key focus areas include:

- 🤖 **RPA Automation** (UiPath, Power Automate)  
- 🛡 **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** (Network Security, IDS/IPS, Risk Assessment)  
- 🧠 **Backend Development** (Node.js, Express, Python, SQL, MongoDB)
